kuczynski | Semantic rules associate sentences with propositions, not directly with facts | Semantic Rules and Propositions
kuczynski | Sentences are digital structures with unique decomposition; pictures are analog and don't so decompose | Digital vs Analog

kuczynski | If Frege is right, "snow" in "Fred believes snow is white" doesn't refer to snow | Consequence of Frege's View
kuczynski | For "Socrates" to refer to Socrates is for "Socrates has phi" to attribute phi to Socrates | Reference and Predication
kuczynski | Reference is to be analyzed in terms of truth-conditional contribution | Reference as Truth-Conditional
kuczynski | The slingshot argument's premises are true only if definite descriptions are read attributively (as quantifiers) | Analysis of Slingshot
