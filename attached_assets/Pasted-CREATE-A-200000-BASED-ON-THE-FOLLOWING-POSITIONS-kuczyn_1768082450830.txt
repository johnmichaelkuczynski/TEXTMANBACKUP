CREATE A 200000 BASED ON THE FOLLOWING POSITIONS: 

kuczynski | Philosophy is the discipline that delineates the structures of the categories in terms of which we think about the world | Philosophy as Science of Science
kuczynski | Philosophy is the science of science, as John Stuart Mill put it | Philosophy as Science of Science
kuczynski | The philosopher is interested in the laws governing the laws; he wants to know what it would even make sense to claim to hold | Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge
kuczynski | Philosophical knowledge is meta-knowledge—knowledge about knowledge | Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge
kuczynski | The philosopher is to the physicist what the physicist is to the engineer, and what the engineer is to the stranded motorist | Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge
kuczynski | We are adept at using our cognitive categories but know little about them; we are blind to them even though but for them we would be blind | Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge
kuczynski | It is hard to identify the principles that guide our thoughts; self-understanding isn't the mind's primary function | Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge
kuczynski | Any case of self-awareness is necessarily derivative of, and for that reason of lesser quality than, some other more fundamental sort of understanding | Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge
kuczynski | Pre-Fregean philosophers thought they were studying the most general features of the actual world; Frege showed this is wrong | Analytic Philosophy
kuczynski | Analytic philosophers do figure out what there could be by analyzing statements; statements that make sense describe possible realities | Analytic Philosophy
kuczynski | Any interest that philosophers have in the actual is subordinate to their interest in the possible | Analytic Philosophy
kuczynski | Logical form does not equal grammatical form—this is Frege's key insight | Logical Form vs Grammatical Form
kuczynski | When people have an obviously correct belief that seems to have an absurd consequence, they should ask whether that absurdity really is a consequence of that belief | Frege's Legacy
kuczynski | Philosophical insight is acquired not by doing para-science, but by analyzing meanings—not by positing entities, but by clarifying statements | Philosophical Method
kuczynski | Analytic philosophy is philosophy that is driven by acceptance of the principle that grammatical form may not coincide with logical form | Analytic Philosophy
kuczynski | The statement "nothing is a square circle" does not say that some non-entity is a square circle but that the property of being a square circle is uninstantiated | Logical Form vs Grammatical Form
kuczynski | Quantifier-expressions like "someone" and "nothing" do not refer to any object; they are devices of quantification, not reference | Quantifiers and Reference
kuczynski | "Someone smokes" doesn't attribute the property of smoking to any individual; it says that the property of being a smoker is instantiated | Quantifiers and Reference
kuczynski | Words are ambiguous, not people; the idea of an "ambiguous person" picked out by "someone" is incoherent | Quantifiers and Reference
kuczynski | Every English speaker understands English sentences, but knowing what one knows in understanding them isn't trivial | Semantic Understanding
kuczynski | The semanticist clarifies the structure of meanings already known; he isn't a translator | Semantic Analysis
kuczynski | Literal meaning is often cloaked by the pre-semantic information through which it is grasped | Literal Meaning
kuczynski | Performative utterances are meaningful but aren't affirmations of pre-existing facts | Performative Utterances
kuczynski | If "grass is green" didn't affirm anything when occurring on its own, then conditional statements containing it would be meaningless | Propositional Content
kuczynski | Embedding a sentence P in "if P, then Q" does not typically change P's meaning | Compositionality
kuczynski | If P meant one thing on its own and a different thing in "if P, then Q," it would become impossible to state indirect arguments | Compositionality
kuczynski | Any sentence is meaningful if it attributes some property to some object | Meaning as Property Attribution
kuczynski | A sentence is meaningful if, for some object x and some property phi, the sentence says that x has phi | Theory of Meaning
kuczynski | Sentences can be reparsed to show that all non-compound sentences have the form "x has phi" | Logical Form
kuczynski | Relational sentences like "Bob loves Sally" can be reparsed as property attributions to ordered pairs | Logical Form
kuczynski | Negative sentences like "Smith doesn't smoke" are equivalent with "the proposition that Smith smokes is false" | Logical Form of Negation
kuczynski | Quantified generalizations say how many members one class of objects has in common with another class | Quantification
kuczynski | Wittgenstein's picture theory of meaning is either empty or false | Critique of Picture Theory
kuczynski | Sentences are not pictures of the facts they describe; their relationship to facts is mediated by conventions | Critique of Picture Theory
kuczynski | To the extent that a given thing is functioning as a linguistic expression, it is not functioning as a picture | Language vs Pictures
kuczynski | Sentences are digital structures with unique decomposition into discrete parts; pictures are not | Digital vs Analog Representation
kuczynski | Pictures have structures radically different from sentences; sentences decompose into finite discrete parts while pictures do not | Digital vs Analog Representation
kuczynski | The semantic rules of English do not associate sentences with facts; they associate sentences with propositions | Semantic Rules
kuczynski | A language is a systematic way of pairing off sentences with meanings; any rule that assigns meaning to an expression is a semantic rule | Semantic Rules
kuczynski | Semantic rules assign meanings to properties of physical objects—to morphological or acoustical properties | Semantic Rules
kuczynski | Something isn't a sentence until a meaning has been assigned to it; expressions aren't assigned meanings, they already have them | Nature of Expression
kuczynski | The function-theoretic view that semantic rules are mathematical functions is false | Critique of Function-Theoretic Semantics
kuczynski | The rule that assigns a referent to "Socrates" has always existed and always will; it existed before English came into existence | Semantic Rules as Eternal
kuczynski | Social conventions don't create semantic rules; they merely select among pre-existing rules | Semantic Rules and Convention
kuczynski | Observance of semantic rules is a pre-condition for language mastery, not something that can be obeyed or disobeyed | Semantic Rules
kuczynski | The English language assigns meanings to sentences and sentences to meanings; languages are sets of semantic rules | Language as System of Rules
kuczynski | According to empiricism, all knowledge is known strictly on the basis of sense-perception | Empiricism Defined
kuczynski | Much of what we know can't be embodied in images of any kind | Limits of Imagistic Knowledge
kuczynski | Nothing could physically resemble the operation of negation, since it isn't something that could possibly be sense-perceived | Non-Perceptual Concepts
kuczynski | The rules that we use to make inferences from perceptual experience cannot themselves be learned strictly on the basis of sense-perception | Critique of Empiricism
kuczynski | The real problem with empiricism is that inference rules cannot be learned perceptually | Critique of Empiricism
kuczynski | Sentences depict facts by way of having propositions for their meanings | Propositions and Facts
kuczynski | Pictures go straight to facts; sentences go through propositions | Pictures vs Sentences
kuczynski | Russell's theory of descriptions holds that definite descriptions are not referring expressions but quantificational devices | Russell's Theory of Descriptions
kuczynski | For "Socrates" to refer to Socrates is for sentences of the form "...Socrates..." to be about Socrates | Reference and Truth Conditions
kuczynski | The meaning of a name is given by what it contributes to the meanings of sentences containing it | Contextual Theory of Meaning
kuczynski | Reference is to be understood in terms of truth-conditional contribution | Reference and Truth Conditions
kuczynski | Frege's sense/reference distinction embodies a conception of reference that leads to absurd consequences | Critique of Frege
kuczynski | The slingshot argument fails because it embodies a spurious conception of reference indistinguishable from quantification | Critique of Slingshot Arguments
kuczynski | Logically equivalent expressions can have different referents contrary to what slingshot arguments assume | Critique of Slingshot Arguments
kuczynski | True sentences do not all refer to the same thing (the True); the slingshot argument's conclusion is false | Critique of Slingshot Arguments
kuczynski | Sentences don't refer to truth-values; they express propositions | Sentences and Propositions
kuczynski | Frege's theory of indirect reference (that expressions in belief contexts refer to their customary senses) is ad hoc and incoherent | Critique of Frege
kuczynski | Kripke's necessary a posteriori thesis is false; what seems to be necessary a posteriori knowledge is really a priori knowledge | Critique of Kripke
kuczynski | We don't think in language; thinking is often a prerequisite to using language | Thought vs Language
kuczynski | We can have thoughts that we are incapable of putting into words | Thought vs Language
kuczynski | Version #1 of the thesis that we think in language (that English speakers think in English, etc.) is wrong | Thought vs Language
kuczynski | Version #2 of the thesis (that we think in an innate language of thought) is also false | Thought vs Language
kuczynski | In order to learn a language, one must already be able to think | Priority of Thought over Language
kuczynski | Different sentences can have the same meaning, showing that thinking is not identical with entertaining sentences | Thought vs Language
kuczynski | If we thought in language, we couldn't disambiguate ambiguous sentences | Thought vs Language
kuczynski | People who speak different languages can have the same thoughts | Universality of Thought
kuczynski | Understanding sentences involves thought; you must be able to think to understand what is meant | Understanding and Thought
kuczynski | The language of thought hypothesis faces a vicious circularity: understanding a language requires knowing semantic rules | Critique of Language of Thought
kuczynski | Mental imagery facilitates thought but is not constitutive of thought | Mental Imagery
kuczynski | Just as one can manipulate electrical activity by manipulating computer icons, one can manipulate ratiocinative activity by manipulating cognitive imagery | Mental Imagery and Cognition
kuczynski | Consciousness integrates otherwise mutually isolated streams of cognitive activity | Function of Consciousness
kuczynski | Knowledge of a language provides a rich system of icons by means of which one can manage cognitive activities | Language and Cognition
kuczynski | Wittgenstein's contention that there cannot be a private language is mistaken | Critique of Private Language Argument
kuczynski | Wittgenstein's view that thinking consists of manipulating expressions is inconsistent with the fact that thinking is prerequisite to meaningful language use | Critique of Wittgenstein
kuczynski | Not all mental states are images or sensations; beliefs are mental states that are not phenomenologically pregnant | Mental States
kuczynski | Thoughts, unlike itches and tickles, aren't phenomenologically pregnant | Nature of Thought
kuczynski | Hume's argument that introspection reveals only sensations assumes that everything there is to know about one's mind is known quasi-perceptually | Critique of Hume
kuczynski | Wittgenstein's Rule Following Argument falsely assumes that all mental states are images or sensations | Critique of Wittgenstein
kuczynski | Following a rule is a psychological act, contrary to Wittgenstein's claim | Rule Following
kuczynski | Your belief that 1 + 1 = 2 isn't an image or sensation; deploying that belief isn't experiencing images or sensations | Nature of Belief
kuczynski | The skeptic's claim that we might be systematically deceived about the external world is incoherent | Refutation of Skepticism
kuczynski | For thoughts to be consistently wrong about the external world, they must be about the external world; but thoughts that are about X cannot be systematically wrong about X | Refutation of Skepticism
kuczynski | It is incoherent to suppose that our beliefs are about X and that they consistently misdescribe X | Refutation of Skepticism
kuczynski | Thoughts are essentially about a certain kind of thing; their aboutness is not severable from their accuracy | Intentionality and Truth
kuczynski | Hume's skeptical argument about induction assumes that the primary form of non-deductive inference is induction by enumeration | Critique of Hume on Induction
kuczynski | Induction by enumeration is less important than, and subordinate to, inference to the best explanation | Inference to Best Explanation
kuczynski | The principle that good explanations minimize causal anomalies (MC) is analytically true | Explanation and Anomalies
kuczynski | Unlike the Uniformity Principle, MC is analytically true and doesn't need inductive validation | Explanation and Anomalies
kuczynski | The gambler's fallacy shows that induction by enumeration is, in and of itself, a fallacious form of reasoning | Critique of Induction by Enumeration
kuczynski | Any non-fallacious "induction by enumeration" is really a case of inference to the best explanation | Inference to Best Explanation
kuczynski | Past phi's being psi's gives reason to believe future phi's will be psi's only insofar as it suggests a mechanism disposing phi's to be psi's | Basis of Induction
kuczynski | In making an inductive inference, one doesn't assume the Uniformity Principle; one assumes that explanations should minimize causal anomalies | Inductive Inference
kuczynski | The purpose of explanation is to minimize the breadth and depth of what must be taken for granted | Nature of Explanation
kuczynski | The more a proposed theory requires you to say "things just happen that way," the less successful an explanation it is | Nature of Explanation
kuczynski | Ceteris paribus the best explanation is the one that leaves us with the fewest unexplained explainers | Best Explanation
kuczynski | Berkeley was the first model-theorist; he recognized that perception apprises us only of structure | Berkeley's Contribution
kuczynski | Our knowledge of the world is strictly comparative; we know how fast, heavy, hot, big a thing is only relative to other things | Comparative Nature of Knowledge
kuczynski | Perception apprises us only of structure; anything with the requisite structure is equally consistent with our perceptions | Structural Knowledge
kuczynski | Berkeley was the first to recognize the distinction between grammatical structure and logical form | Berkeley's Contribution
kuczynski | Many "statements" are really statement-forms; the terms in them are variables that can be replaced with constants | Statements vs Statement-Forms
kuczynski | Determinism is the view that how the world is at any given point in time fixes how it will be in every respect at all later times | Determinism Defined
kuczynski | Indeterminism is a very moderate doctrine; it only requires one event that doesn't have to occur | Indeterminism Defined
kuczynski | Determinism is much harder to establish than indeterminism | Determinism vs Indeterminism
kuczynski | A process is random if and only if it was not fated to happen | Definition of Randomness
kuczynski | Randomness is not the same as unpredictability; a random event can be predictable and a predictable event can be non-random | Randomness vs Unpredictability
kuczynski | A process is unpredictable if it cannot be predicted, regardless of whether it was fated to happen | Definition of Unpredictability
kuczynski | In a deterministic universe, everything is fated to happen; in an indeterministic universe, at least one event is not fated | Determinism and Fate
kuczynski | Program-causes (underlying structures that dispose things to behave in certain ways) are central to prediction and explanation | Program Causes
kuczynski | Explanation is reverse-prediction; one predicts from cause to effect, one explains from effect to cause | Prediction and Explanation
kuczynski | Hume's analysis of causality is untenable for multiple reasons | Critique of Hume on Causation
kuczynski | Hume's analysis cannot distinguish between actual causation and pseudo-causation (epiphenomenal causation) | Critique of Hume on Causation
kuczynski | Hume's analysis entails that events can't be space-time neighbors without one causing the other, which is false | Critique of Hume on Causation
kuczynski | Hume's analysis is viciously circular because it analyzes causality in terms of spatiotemporal adjacency, but spatiotemporal relations are causal relations | Critique of Hume on Causation
kuczynski | According to modern physics, temporal order is to be understood in causal terms: E1 precedes E2 iff a signal can go from E1 to E2 | Causality and Time
kuczynski | Spatial order is also causal: x and y are in different places exactly if something affecting one may fail to affect the other | Causality and Space
kuczynski | To occupy a place is to make it harder for other things to enter that place; spatial occupancy is a causal concept | Causality and Space
kuczynski | We do see causal processes; anything that persists for any amount of time is a causal series | Perception of Causation
kuczynski | Anything seen as persisting is seen as a causal process | Perception of Causation
kuczynski | The relational conception of space-time (that spatiotemporal positions are relations between events) is correct | Space-Time as Relational
kuczynski | Hume was led astray about causality by the technological limitations of his time | Critique of Hume on Causation
kuczynski | The counterfactual analysis of causality (x caused y iff if x hadn't happened, y wouldn't have) is false | Critique of Counterfactual Analysis
kuczynski | Causal anomalies must be minimized; this is the fundamental principle of explanation | Explanation as Anomaly Elimination
kuczynski | Explanation consists of the elimination of discontinuities | Explanation as Discontinuity Elimination
kuczynski | A good hypothesis eliminates discontinuities; the hypothesis that creates more discontinuities is worse | Quality of Hypotheses
kuczynski | Discontinuity-elimination is the essence of explanation | Nature of Explanation
kuczynski | Theoretical discontinuities (violations of known laws) count as discontinuities to be eliminated | Types of Discontinuities
kuczynski | Probability is a property of statements, not of states of affairs | Probability
kuczynski | Probability statements describe bearing-relations between bodies of data and hypotheses | Probability
kuczynski | Probability is inherently relational; the same proposition may be probable relative to one body of evidence and improbable relative to another | Probability
kuczynski | A complete description of the universe would contain no probability statements; probability is "a measure of ignorance" | Probability as Ignorance
kuczynski | Probability is not subjective; it is a mind-independent logical relationship holding among statements | Objectivity of Probability
kuczynski | To believe P is to be certain that P is correct; data may make P more worthy of belief than not-P without making P worthy of belief | Belief vs Probability
kuczynski | The mental obviously affects the physical; this is the main evidence for materialism | Mind-Body Problem
kuczynski | Anything that affects the physical is ipso facto physical itself | Argument for Materialism
kuczynski | The argument that the mental can't be physical because it doesn't seem like anything physical is hard to dismiss | Argument for Dualism
kuczynski | We experience our experiences as being totally unlike physical entities | Qualia
kuczynski | It makes no sense to suppose that we experience our experiences as being different from how they really are | Qualia
kuczynski | Materialism is probably correct, but psychological truths are incapable of being understood in terms of physical truths | Materialism with Irreducibility
kuczynski | Dual aspect theory is incoherent; the "thing" of which mental and physical are aspects can't be either mental or physical | Critique of Dual Aspect Theory
kuczynski | Eliminativism about the mental is obviously false; the existence of pains, tickles, etc., is easily verified | Critique of Eliminativism
kuczynski | One must distinguish "subjective" as biased from "subjective" as having first-person ontology | Two Senses of Subjective
kuczynski | Behaviorism is false; how a person reacts to input depends on existing mental states, not just the input | Critique of Behaviorism
kuczynski | Mental states cannot be reduced to behavioral dispositions; at most they can be reduced to dispositions plus mental states | Critique of Behaviorism
kuczynski | Functionalism says that for a brain-state to be a belief is for it to have the right causes and effects | Functionalism Defined
kuczynski | Functionalism is wrong because for something to be a pain is for it to feel a certain way; causal role is secondary | Critique of Functionalism
kuczynski | A pain's having a given causal role is a consequence of its being a pain; being a pain is not a consequence of having that role | Critique of Functionalism
kuczynski | Functionalism makes content too brittle; no two mental entities have exactly the same causal roles | Critique of Functionalism
kuczynski | If functionalism is right, then mental states cannot cause behavior; the theory strips the mental of causal powers | Critique of Functionalism
kuczynski | The Computational Theory of Mind is a form of materialism | Computational Theory of Mind
kuczynski | Computers manipulate representations that have meaning only by virtue of our interpretive practices | Computers and Meaning
kuczynski | A thing is a prediction-enabling complex of events | Definition of Thinghood
kuczynski | Thinghood comes in degrees; some things are "thingier" than others | Thinghood as Degree
kuczynski | To be a thing is to be a prediction-enabling complex of events; predictively inert event-complexes are non-things | Thinghood and Prediction
kuczynski | Dynamic integrity is the essence of thinghood | Dynamic Integrity
kuczynski | A given system of events can be thing-like in some explanatory contexts while being unthing-like in others | Contextual Nature of Thinghood
kuczynski | Things don't have to be solid; stars are as thingy as rocks because they have dynamic integrity | Thinghood and Solidity
kuczynski | Objects are identical with causal series; a given object ceases to exist when the corresponding causal series is severed | Personal Identity
kuczynski | Time-travel involving discontinuous leaps from one time to another is logically false, not just empirically impossible | Impossibility of Time Travel
kuczynski | Where Smith is during a supposed time-travel interval determines whether he continues to exist | Personal Identity
kuczynski | If Smith is nowhere during the interval, whatever pops into existence later isn't numerically identical with Smith | Personal Identity
kuczynski | Time-travel backwards in time is logically impossible | Impossibility of Time Travel
kuczynski | One can have knowledge by acquaintance of something while also having knowledge by description of it | Two Kinds of Knowledge
kuczynski | Mental contents can be conscious in two senses: as constituents of consciousness, or as things we are conscious of | Two Senses of Conscious
kuczynski | Beliefs are not constituents of consciousness but enduring psychological structures | Nature of Belief
kuczynski | Your knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 is psychologically operative even when you are not consciously thinking it | Unconscious Knowledge
kuczynski | Propositional attitudes are enduring structures to be distinguished from the constituents of consciousness they may give rise to | Propositional Attitudes
kuczynski | Given only that you know some fact, there is no phenomenologically pregnant entity that must be in your consciousness | Knowledge and Phenomenology
kuczynski | Emotions are distinct from their manifestations in consciousness; your love for your mother is an enduring structure | Emotions as Structures
kuczynski | A given emotion can give rise to conscious events of very different kinds | Emotions and Consciousness
kuczynski | One can have divergent attitudes towards the same propositional attitude of one's own | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Self-deception seems to presuppose that at some level one has knowledge of the thing of which one lacks conscious knowledge | Self-Deception
kuczynski | Repression is not driving known content into the unconscious; it is failure to exercise due diligence in verifying suspicions | Nature of Repression
kuczynski | The customary conception of repression (knowingly driving content into unconscious) is erroneous | Critique of Folk Psychology of Repression
kuczynski | Repression involves choosing not to learn something that, if learned, one would wish one had never learned | Nature of Repression
kuczynski | What we call "repressed knowledge" refers to suspicions we have chosen not to verify | Nature of Repression
kuczynski | Every case of repression involves intrapsychic conflict, but the conflict is between wishing to know and wishing not to know | Intrapsychic Conflict
kuczynski | Freud didn't show that unconscious mental processes exist; he showed that we have thoughts that we don't want ourselves to know | Freud's Contribution
kuczynski | There is non-Freudian unconscious mentation in addition to Freudian unconscious processes | Unconscious Processes
kuczynski | Sociopathy involves telling oneself one is something one isn't; it involves chronic self-deception | Sociopathy
kuczynski | The sociopath constantly rationalizes his behavior and substitutes "virtuous" motives for actual ones | Sociopathy
kuczynski | The psychopath has no self and never had one; a self is an integrated and relatively stable core of personality | Psychopathy
kuczynski | The sociopath once had a self but is now fragmenting; the psychopath never had one | Sociopathy vs Psychopathy
kuczynski | Stalin was neither sociopath nor psychopath; he knew what he was (a predator) and didn't deceive himself | Evil vs Mental Illness
kuczynski | According to Davidson, an intention is simply one's strongest desire; this analysis embodies several confusions | Critique of Davidson on Intentions
kuczynski | A desire directly converted into overt behavior is a reaction, not an action proper | Actions vs Reactions
kuczynski | For a desire to lead to action, it must be inhibited and scrutinized to ensure it embodies the right values | Nature of Action
kuczynski | An intention is not a desire; it is a judgment | Nature of Intention
kuczynski | If Davidson were right, we'd never act, only react; we'd be like pinballs bouncing between desires | Critique of Davidson
kuczynski | We make plans and tend to stick with them; this is incompatible with Davidson's view | Planning and Agency
kuczynski | Actions are expressions of value-driven decisions to lift inhibitions on desires | Nature of Action
kuczynski | Values are not desires; values are judgments about how to extend the hegemony of one's agency | Values vs Desires
kuczynski | There are two kinds of strength a desire can have: intrinsic strength and organization-dependent strength | Strength of Desires
kuczynski | A desire can be extremely strong but if it isn't part of one's psychological organization, it won't lead to action | Desire and Action
kuczynski | Nietzsche's ethical egoism was an exhortation to avoid sociopathy and hypocrisy | Interpretation of Nietzsche
kuczynski | Ethical theories other than ethical egoism either damage their adherents or turn them into frauds or both | Critique of Ethics
kuczynski | EE satisfies the desideratum that an ethical theory shouldn't require people to diminish themselves | Defense of Ethical Egoism
kuczynski | All ethical theories other than EE require one to put others' interests ahead of one's own, which is psychologically unsustainable | Critique of Ethics
kuczynski | In advocating EE, Nietzsche was trying to steer people away from sociopathy-conducive rationalizations | Interpretation of Nietzsche
kuczynski | Analytic knowledge is knowledge arrived at strictly through the analysis of concepts | Analytic Knowledge Defined
kuczynski | A priori knowledge is knowledge that is constitutive of our cognitive machinery; it's hardwired into us | A Priori Knowledge Defined
kuczynski | Empirical knowledge is knowledge based at least partly on the testimony of the senses | Empirical Knowledge Defined
kuczynski | Synthetic knowledge is non-analytic knowledge | Synthetic Knowledge Defined
kuczynski | A proposition is contingent if there are conceivable circumstances where it is true and also conceivable circumstances where it is false | Contingency Defined
kuczynski | Consequentialism is the doctrine that an act's moral status is entirely a function of its effects | Consequentialism Defined
kuczynski | Deontology holds that an act's moral status depends on whether it embodies due regard for ethical duties and others' rights | Deontology Defined
kuczynski | A counterfactual is a statement of the form: if P were the case, then Q would also be the case | Counterfactual Defined
kuczynski | A definite description is an expression of the form "the phi" where phi is in the singular | Definite Description Defined
kuczynski | To define an expression is to say what it means; expressions are defined, not objects | Definition Defined
kuczynski | A defeasible tendency or principle is one that can be overridden | Defeasibility Defined
kuczynski | Content-externalism holds that qualitatively identical creatures can have different mental contents due to different causal histories | Content Externalism Defined
kuczynski | An indexical is an expression whose reference varies systematically with context | Indexicals Defined
kuczynski | A demonstrative is an indexical that must be accompanied by an act of demonstration | Demonstratives Defined
kuczynski | Connectives attribute properties to propositions | Connectives Defined
kuczynski | Quantifiers are connectives that attribute properties to infinitely large classes of propositions | Quantifiers Defined
kuczynski | The Duhem-Quine thesis (that no theory does better or worse than any other at modeling data) is either empty or false | Critique of Duhem-Quine
kuczynski | If Quine's thesis is non-trivial, it's clearly false; some theories obviously account for data better than others | Critique of Duhem-Quine
kuczynski | Quine's suggestion that we "plead hallucination" to save a theory creates more anomalies than it eliminates | Critique of Duhem-Quine
kuczynski | All analytic truth is not formal truth; there are analytically true sentences that aren't formally true | Analytic vs Formal Truth
kuczynski | Wittgenstein was wrong that all non-empirical truths are tautologous | Critique of Wittgenstein's Tractatus
kuczynski | Not all entailment is formal entailment; some analytic truths cannot be reduced to logical form | Analytic vs Formal Entailment
kuczynski | A logical constant is any expression other than a variable that occurs in a pure, universally true open-sentence | Logical Constant Defined
kuczynski | The claim that analytic truth is formal truth is not only wrong but incoherent | Critique of Tractatus
kuczynski | First-class philosophical thinkers are more likely to use their intelligence to defend orthodoxies than to look for the truth | Sociology of Philosophy
kuczynski | High-ranking members of high-ranking philosophy departments advocated views that any ten year old knows to be false | Sociology of Philosophy
kuczynski | Ryle, Strawson, and Austin spent years urging acceptance of views that were 100% false | Critique of Oxford Philosophy
kuczynski | Professors at first-tier institutions aren't as likely as one would think to produce better work than those at bottom-tier universities | Sociology of Philosophy
kuczynski | Austin's contention that not all meaningful sentences affirm propositions is false | Critique of Austin
kuczynski | Strawson's view that definite descriptions presuppose rather than assert existence is problematic | Critique of Strawson
kuczynski | Ryle's behavioristic analysis of mental concepts is fundamentally mistaken | Critique of Ryle
kuczynski | The verification principle of meaning (that a sentence is meaningful only if verifiable) is self-refuting | Critique of Verificationism
kuczynski | Idealism (the view that only minds and mental contents exist) is false | Critique of Idealism
kuczynski | Berkeley's arguments for idealism do not succeed, though he had important insights | Critique of Berkeley
kuczynski | Statements about perceptions cannot be equivalent with statements about objects | Critique of Phenomenalism
kuczynski | Any perception is to the effect that objects that aren't part of you bear relations to one another | Content of Perception
kuczynski | To the extent that our perceptions are evidence of anything, they are evidence of trans-perceptual objects | Perception and External World
kuczynski | A thing that persists through time is a causal series; the stages are causally connected | Persistence and Causation
kuczynski | Numerical identity through time requires causal continuity between earlier and later stages | Persistence and Identity
kuczynski | If a causal series is severed, the corresponding object ceases to exist | Persistence and Identity
kuczynski | My car damaged yesterday is numerically identical with my car today because a continuous causal series mediates them | Persistence and Identity
kuczynski | An exact duplicate that is not causally continuous with the original is not numerically identical with it | Persistence and Identity
kuczynski | Event, space, time, cause, persistence, thing, mind, perception, belief, knowledge, language, truth, value-judgment, law, justice—these are the categories philosophy studies | Categories of Philosophy
kuczynski | Although it is only through cognitive categories that we can think about the world, they are seldom objects of thought | Cognitive Categories
kuczynski | We know much but have little idea what it is that we know; philosophy supplies this missing meta-knowledge | Philosophy as Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Self-understanding isn't the mind's primary function; the idea of a mind thinking only about itself is incoherent | Limits of Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Philosophy is the analysis of the preconditions of all knowledge | Philosophy as Analysis of Knowledge
kuczynski | The philosopher wants to know the laws that the laws can't break | Philosophy as Analysis of Necessity
kuczynski | The non-philosopher wants to know specifics; the philosopher wants to know the categories underlying such knowledge | Philosophical vs Everyday Knowledge
kuczynski | Frege's legacy: when beliefs have apparently absurd consequences, ask whether those are really consequences | Frege's Method
kuczynski | We develop ad hoc hypotheses to make our mistakes work, undermining the integrity of our belief systems | Error and Ad Hoc Reasoning
kuczynski | Logicians and linguists often mistake grammatical properties for logical properties | Grammar vs Logic
kuczynski | "Nothing" is not a name for a non-entity; "nothing is a square circle" doesn't predicate square-circularity of a non-entity | Analysis of "Nothing"
kuczynski | "Nobody likes Larry" doesn't say that some un-person likes Larry; it says the set of Larry-likers is empty | Analysis of "Nobody"
kuczynski | Quantified statements attribute properties to properties, not to individuals | Quantification and Properties
kuczynski | "Someone is tall" attributes the property of being instantiated to the property of tallness | Quantification and Properties
kuczynski | If there did exist an ambiguous person picked out by "someone," sentences would unambiguously predicate properties of that person | Critique of Ambiguous Objects
kuczynski | There is no individual N such that it is self-contradictory to say that someone smokes but N does not | No Referent for "Someone"
kuczynski | The meaning of "something" is given by the rule that "something has phi" is true iff phi is instantiated | Contextual Definition
kuczynski | The meaning of "every person" is given by the rule that "every person has phi" means the property of being a human non-phi isn't instantiated | Contextual Definition
kuczynski | The meaning of "not" is given by the rule that not-S is true just in case S is false | Contextual Definition
kuczynski | All denotative definitions are contextual definitions, but not vice versa | Types of Definition
kuczynski | Whenever an expression is defined contextually, sentences containing it must be reparsed for their meanings to be clear | Contextual Definition
kuczynski | Propositional attitudes involve a relation between a person and a proposition | Propositional Attitudes Defined
kuczynski | The content of a statement or belief is what must hold for it to be correct | Content Defined
kuczynski | Thoughts are not identical with sentence-tokens; knowledge of language enhances cognitive ability without thoughts being sentences | Thought and Language
kuczynski | Mental images allow us to manage thought-processes that we otherwise couldn't manage | Function of Mental Imagery
kuczynski | We can manipulate otherwise uncontrollable patterns of ratiocinative activity by manipulating cognitive imagery | Mental Imagery and Control
