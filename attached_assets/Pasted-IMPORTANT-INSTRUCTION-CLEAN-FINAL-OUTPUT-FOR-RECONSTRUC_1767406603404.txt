IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: CLEAN FINAL OUTPUT FOR RECONSTRUCTION

The main reconstruction function (the one that generates the initial academic paper from the user's claims and prompt) MUST produce ONLY the pristine essay text.

Requirements:
- Output ONLY the full academic paper.
- NO meta-data of any kind.
- NO scores (e.g., Score: 100/100).
- NO "POSITION" labels.
- NO "DEFENSE:" lines.
- NO "Defense generation failed" messages.
- NO category headers (e.g., CATEGORY: AI LOGIC).
- NO summaries.
- NO report wrappers.
- NO ═════════════════ lines or any decorative separators.
- NO abstracts repeated separately.
- NO per-position breakdowns.

The output should be ONE single, clean, coherent academic essay from start to finish — exactly like a human would submit it.

Implementation steps:
1. In the reconstruction phase, generate and collect all successful chunk outputs as before.
2. After all chunks are generated, validated, and repaired:
   - Concatenate only the actual essay text from the successful chunks/sections.
   - Join them with "\n\n" (or appropriate paragraph breaks).
   - If needed, add clean section titles (I., II., etc. or custom headings) based on the skeleton's logicalSections.
3. In the final yield or return for the reconstruction/complete event:
   - Return ONLY the concatenated essay string.
   - Do NOT include any internal diagnostics, scores, stitch results, or position lists.
   - Example of correct final output:
     "The Limits of Classical Logic and the Case for Alternative Reasoning Systems: A Philosophical Defense

     I. Introduction
     ...

     VII. Conclusion
     ..."

4. Move all meta-data (scores, failures, stitch validation, etc.) to a separate debug/log channel or optional debug mode ONLY — never in the main user-facing output.

The user should receive nothing but the ready-to-use academic paper. No cleaning required.

Apply this change to the reconstruction (first phase) output immediately. The full-suite can keep internal meta for objections/repair if needed, but the initial reconstruction must be pristine.
