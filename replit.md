- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, integrating multiple LLMs, document processing, speech-to-text, and email services.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for user, document, analysis, and cognitive profile data.
- **Core Services**:
    - **Multi-Model Intelligence Evaluation**: A 4-phase system assessing 17 cognitive dimensions, supporting genre-aware analysis.
    - **Intelligent Rewrite Function (MAXINTEL)**: Recursively optimizes text for intelligence scores, with custom instructions and external knowledge integration.
    - **GPT Bypass Humanizer**: Transforms AI-generated text to bypass AI detection.
    - **Coherence Meter**: Supports up to 5000-word inputs with Global Coherence Preservation Protocol. Includes specialized modes:
        - **Mathematical Proof System** (COHERENCE, COGENCY, MAX COHERENCE, MAXIMIZE TRUTH).
        - **Scientific-Explanatory Coherence Type**: Dual assessment of logical consistency and scientific accuracy, with rewrite function to correct pseudoscientific claims.
    - **Text Model Validator**: Exclusively focused on the RECONSTRUCTION function for conservative charitable interpretation.
    - **AI Chat Assistant**: Provides conversation history and context from the Zhi Database.
    - **Conservative Reconstruction**: "Charitable Interpretation" mode for generating coherent essays articulating a text's unified argument, with advanced outline-first and cross-chunk strategies for medium and long documents. Features:
        - **Database-backed projects**: Stores reconstruction projects with status tracking (processing, completed, failed)
        - **Async processing**: Uses crossChunkReconstruct service with Anthropic Claude for background processing
        - **Real-time polling**: Frontend polls every 5 seconds for status updates with proper cleanup on unmount
        - **Supports up to 100,000 words**: Handles large documents through chunked processing
    - **Universal Expansion Service** (Jan 2026): Protocol-based reconstruction that obeys ALL user instructions exactly, regardless of input length. Key features:
        - **No thresholds**: Input length is irrelevant; user instructions are ALWAYS followed
        - **Target word count parsing**: Detects "expand to X words" instructions and delivers exact output
        - **Structure parsing**: Detects chapter/section specifications with word counts (e.g., "CHAPTER 1: Introduction (3,500 words)")
        - **Citation support**: Parses requests for academic citations and philosopher references
        - **Constraint handling**: Respects academic register, no bullet points, subsection requirements
        - **Section-by-section generation**: Creates outline first, then generates each section with coherence context
        - Example: 165-word input + "EXPAND TO 20,000 WORDS" → produces full 20,000-word thesis with specified structure
        - **Word Count Enforcement with Coherent Continuations** (Jan 2026): Ensures documents ALWAYS meet target word counts:
            - After initial chunk processing, checks if cumulative word count < targetMinWords
            - If shortfall detected, reads all existing content from database for context
            - Generates coherent continuation chunks (up to 15 attempts, ~4000 words each)
            - Each continuation reads last ~2000 words for seamless continuation
            - Continuations saved as database chunks with proper delta/coherence tracking
            - System accepts 95%+ of target if LLM reaches natural conclusion
            - Completion message includes: targetMet status, percentage, shortfall amount, failure reasons
    - **Full Suite Pipeline**: One-click execution of Reconstruction, Objections, and Objection-Proof Final Version.
    - **Objections Function**: Generates 25 likely objections with compelling counter-arguments. For large documents (1,200+ words), uses outline-first approach that extracts argument structure first, then generates categorized objections (logical, evidential, practical, audience-specific, methodological) with severity ratings.
    - **Generate Objection-Proof Version (Bullet-Proof Rewrite)**: Rewrites text to preemptively address identified objections. Enhanced with:
        - **Claim-aware sectioning**: Detects claim-based structure (Claim 1:, Claim 2:, etc.) and preserves each claim with its paragraphs as a unit
        - **Header preservation**: Extracts and validates original claim headers, auto-prepends if missing
        - **Paragraph count enforcement**: Requires exact match, retries with stricter prompt if count differs
        - **Hedging detector**: Scans for 15 forbidden hedging phrases, retries if excessive hedging found
        - **Retry mechanism**: Up to 2 retries with progressively stricter instructions for structural compliance
        - **Anti-hedging guidance**: Produces confident prose that integrates objection-responses as assertions, not qualifications
        - **Two-Tier Format Preservation System** (Dec 2025):
            - **Custom Instruction Format Detection**: Detects glossary, numbered list, and non-paragraph formats from user instructions
            - **Input Format Detection**: Detects when reconstruction output is already in numbered format (e.g., "1. 'Claim...' Defense paragraphs")
            - **Format-Preserving Rewrite**: When numbered format detected in input, enforces EXACT item count and preserves quoted claims verbatim
            - **Direct Format Rewrite**: Bypasses section-based processing for special formats (glossaries, lists) to respect exact formatting requirements
    - **Global Coherence State (GCS) System**: Architectural overhaul for coherence tracking across chunks, with mode-specific state dimensions for 8 coherence types.
    - **TextStats Component with AI Detection**: Displays word/character counts and GPTZero-powered AI detection results.
    - **Job History System** (Jan 2026): Persistent tracking and viewing of processing jobs. Features:
        - **Database-backed job storage**: Jobs stored in reconstruction_projects, coherence_documents, coherence_chunks tables
        - **Job History Page**: Accessible from navigation, shows all jobs with status (completed, in-progress, interrupted)
        - **Persistent Job Viewer Modal**: Content always accessible during and after processing via shared modal
        - **Active Job Context**: Tracks current processing job with sessionStorage persistence
        - **View Current Job Button**: Appears in header during active processing
        - **Resume Functionality**: Interrupted jobs can be resumed from where they stopped
        - **Auto-refresh**: Viewer polls every 3 seconds for in-progress jobs
        - **Copy/Download**: Always available for generated content in the viewer
    - **Intelligent Input Interpretation System** (Jan 2026): Smart detection and handling of user inputs across all functions:
        - **Instructions-Only Mode**: Allows users to generate content without source text (e.g., "Write a 50,000 word essay on Freud")
        - **Automatic Swap Detection**: If user places instructions in the text box and content in instructions box, system detects and swaps automatically
        - **Expansion Keyword Detection**: Recognizes keywords like "expand", "write", "generate", "produce", etc.
        - **Full Suite Integration**: All three stages (Reconstruction, Objections, Objection-Proof) use interpreted inputs
        - **Toast Notification**: Users are notified when inputs are automatically interpreted/swapped
    - **NEUROTEXT Core Behavior Rules** (Jan 2026): The app ALWAYS follows user instructions exactly:
        - **Custom Instructions Override**: When user provides instructions (e.g., "TURN INTO ONE MAN PLAY"), the app produces exactly that format, not an academic outline
        - **Auto-Expand Without Instructions**: Small input (<1000 words) + no instructions → auto-expand to 5000 word scholarly version. Large input → expand by 1.5x with real content
        - **Instructions-Only Mode**: User can enter only instructions (e.g., "WRITE A 200K DISSERTATION ON BOTANY") with no source text → app complies
        - **NO PUFFERY Rule**: Every word must carry substantive meaning. No filler or decorative language
        - **NO HEDGING Rule**: Never use hedging language like "may", "might", "perhaps", "arguably"
        - **ZHI 1 Default**: Default LLM provider is now ZHI 1 (OpenAI)
